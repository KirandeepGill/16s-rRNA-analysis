# 16s rRNA analysis

This project uses a publicly available dataset to calculate the relative abundance of the taxa in the samples and their alpha and beta diversity. Using a Phyloseq object from the R library, the R scripts are used to get the taxa abundance and to calculate the between sample and within sample diversity and visualization using ggplot2.
